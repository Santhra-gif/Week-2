  VECTOR_DATABASE_NOTE
========================
 
 A vector database stores, manages and indexes high-dimensional vector data. 
 Data points are stored as arrays of numbers called vectors, which are clustered based on similarity. 
 This design enables low-latency queries, making it ideal for AI applications.
 Vector databases are growing rapidly because they deliver the speed and performance needed for generative AI applications.
 They are able to handle unstructured datasets.

 Vector Databases Functions:
   Vetor storage : Vector databases store the outputs of an embedding model algorithm, the vector embeddings.

   Vector Indexing: Vector databases create indexes on vector embeddings for search functions.

   Similarity search based on querying or prompting: When a user queries or prompts an AI model, the model computes an embedding of the query or prompt. 
                                                     The database then calculates distances between query vectors and vectors stored in the index to return similar results.
