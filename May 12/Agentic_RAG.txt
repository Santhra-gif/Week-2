  Agentic_RAG_Note
====================

Agentic RAG is the use of AI agents to facilitate retrieval augmented generation (RAG).
These systems add AI agents to the RAG pipeline to increase adaptability and accuracy.
It goes beyond traditional RAG by introducing agents that can autonomously plan, execute, and adapt retrieval strategies, ultimately leading to more flexible and powerful applications. 

-RAG :
 Retrieval augmented generation is AI application that connects a generative AI model with an external knowledge base.
 RAG enables LLMs to be more accurate in domain-specific contexts without needing fine-tuning. 

-Agentic AI :
 Agentic AI is a type of AI that can determine and carry out a course of action by itself

-Working :
 Agentic RAG works by incorporating one or more types of AI agents into RAG systems.

-Benefits :
 Increased Adaptability
 Improved Accuracy
 Enhanced Performance
 Greater Flexibility
