   Single-Agent RAG:
==========================
-A single agent handles the entire pipelineâ€”querying, retrieving, and generating responses.
-Simpler to implement and manage; suitable for straightforward tasks.
- Limited scalability and flexibility; may struggle with complex tasks requiring diverse expertise.


   Multi-Agent RAG:
=========================
-Multiple specialized agents collaborate, each handling specific components like retrieval, summarization, or validation.
-Enhanced scalability, modularity, and robustness; agents can be tailored for specific tasks.
-Increased complexity in coordination and communication among agents.
